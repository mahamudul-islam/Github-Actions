1. Create Sample.py
def foo(a):
return a + 2
2. Click Actions
3. Select Pylint
4. Open pylint.yml
5. Only keep python version 3.8 and 3.9 
6. Commit pylint.yml
To fix the job failed
7. edit Sample.py and replace with this:
"""
Helper functions live here
"""


def increment_by_two(var_to_increment):
    """
    This function increments input by two
    :param var_to_increment: param to increment
    :return: incremented variable
    """
    return var_to_increment + 2

8. Commit sample.py and see the changes in Actions

Unit Testing:
9. From Actions click “new workflow”
10. Select Python Application
11. Commit python-app.yml
12. edit python-app.yml:
Change name: Python Application to name: unit tests and commit python-app.yml
13. now go back to repo home and create a new branch called add-tests
14. Now from add file create new file named test_sample.py and write this:

"""
Test helper functions
"""

import unittest
from sample import increment_by_two,

class TestSampleMethods(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Test harness
    """

    def test_increment_by_two(self):
        """
        Test increments
        """
        self.assertEqual(increment_by_two(-2), 0)
        self.assertEqual(increment_by_two(0), 2)
        self.assertEqual(increment_by_two(3), 5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

15. now commit test_sample.py
16. After committing go back to the repo home and open “compare and pull request” and create pull request
17. now open your python-app.yml from add-test branch then copy his python-app.yml contents from his workflow and replace yours with it.
18. Now commit and open pull request and create pull request then merge.
19.now delete add-test branch
